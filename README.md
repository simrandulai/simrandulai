🌟 Fun Fact 

My curiosity about human behavior and social dynamics led me to pursue a degree in Anthropology at UC Berkeley. Growing up, I was fascinated by the History Channel and Egyptology, which sparked my passion for understanding culture and history. Today, I bring that same curiosity and perspective to uncovering insights from data!
